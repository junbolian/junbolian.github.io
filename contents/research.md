My research spans multiple areas of machine learning, optimization, and applied AI. Below are the key directions:

#### Operations Research & Operation Management
Data-driven pricing strategies, inventory management, supply chain management, and platform economics. Combining mathematical modeling with machine learning for decision-making under uncertainty.

#### Generative AI, LLMs & Computer Vision
Large Language Models, diffusion models, 3D generative vision, and texture recognition. Developed novel architectures such as Twisted Convolutional Networks (TCNs) for non-spatial data classification. Inspired by TCNs, TwistNet-2D was further designed for texture image classification, surpassing the latest state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

#### Evolutionary Computation
Evolutionary computation theory and large-scale optimization. Invented multiple algorithms including Human Evolutionary Optimization Algorithm (HEOA), Parrot Optimizer (PO), Educational Competition Optimizer (ECO), and Operator-Programmed Algorithms for Landscape-Aware Black-Box Optimization (OPAL), with papers recognized as **ESI Hot Papers** (TOP 0.1%) and **ESI Highly Cited Papers** (TOP 1%).

#### AI in Food & Agriculture Engineering
Interdisciplinary applications of AI in quality prediction and pattern recognition, including mold detection systems for Chinese herbal medicine and spectroscopy-based food inspection.
